## This is my personal website
I made it to show who I am, what I code, and that I'm not just another GitHub ghost

Built with pure HTML/CSS/JS - no frameworks, no bloat. Just me, a dark theme, and copabilitty track xd

## what's inside

- clean "gotic-minimalist" landing page  
- playable music + background video toggle  
- adaptive performance (works even on potato phones)
- compressed music and video
